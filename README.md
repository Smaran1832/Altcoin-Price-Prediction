# Altcoin-Price-Prediction

#### Altcoins are alternative types of coins under cryptocurrency apart from traditional Bitcoins. They significantly impact the trading market of cryptocurrency and help an investor diversify their portfolio. However, variability and directional fluctuations in the Altcoin prices impact the number of investors showing interest. Moreover, these coins are averse to high drifts due to overall market variability, market sentiments, and socio-economic factors. The proposed study attempts to capture all these significant variables and predicts the price movement of Altcoin using supervised machine learning techniques. Out of all the altcoins, Etherium's price movement was predicted with 71 percent accuracy, which is best in class compared to other models in the literature. In order of priority, bitcoin prices, social media sentiments, and news sentiments significantly impact altcoin price movement. This implies that by studying the bitcoin pricing movement and market sentiments, investors can take wise decision towards Altcoin investments. This study will be helpful for Algo Trading Platforms, Financial Advisors, Trading Experts, Industry Experts, Researchers and Scholars.
